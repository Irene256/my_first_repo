        <p id="intro-text"> I am a Ugandan living in Germany Munich since 2018. In Uganda, I was working with vulnerable communities 
          supporting them with first hand information on improving their health and social well being through social work. I like seeing
          things get done in the simplest way possible through computer use. Thats why I joined ReDI school in 2019 to gain more computer
          skills to improve my work and get more career opportunities.
